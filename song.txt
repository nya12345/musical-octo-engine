… Well I met an old man dying on a train
No more destination, no more pain
Well he said one thing: "Before I graduate
Never let your fear decide your fate"

… I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause, everybody will die
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we love you more than you know

… Well the sun one day will leave us all behind
Unexplainable sightings in the sky
Well I hate to be the one to ruin the night
Right before your, right before your eyes

… I say you kill your heroes and fly, fly, baby don't cry
No need to worry 'cause, everybody will die
Every day we just go, go, baby don't go
Don't you worry we love you more than you know
